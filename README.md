# Hapi Starter (work in progress)

Getting started with Hapi can be challenging, but the benefits are numerous.
This project is a starter project with Hapi. It incorporates many of the best
practices I've found over the last couple years of working with Hapi. Hapi
takes care of the serving up your javascript assets and also provides the json
api to feed data into the app.

Api documentation can be found at `/docs` once the server in running.

## Getting started

    npm install
    npm run build
    npm start

## TODO

- Show more examples of routes with validation
- Add another controller
- Wire up javascript app with api endpoints
- Show usage of Boom for errors
- Break `good_bunyan` into its own library
- Improve api docs with swagger
