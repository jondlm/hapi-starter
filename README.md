# Hapi Starter

Getting started with Hapi can be challenging, but the benefits are numerous.
This project is a starter project with Hapi and react. It incorporates many of
the best practices I've found over the last couple years of working with Hapi.
Hapi takes care of the serving up the react assets and also provides the json
api to feed data into the app.

Api documentation can be found at `/docs` once the server in running.

## Getting started

    npm install
    npm run build
    node index.js
